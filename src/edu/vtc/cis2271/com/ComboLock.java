/**
 * Declare a class ComboLock that works like the combination lock in a gym locker, as shown here.
 * The lock is constructed with a combinationâ€”three numbers between 0 and 39. The reset method
 * resets the dial so that it points to 0. The turnLeft and turnRight methods turn the dial by
 * a given number of ticks to the left or right. The open method attempts to open the lock.
 * The lock opens if the user first turned it right to the first number in the combination,
 * then left to the second, and then right to the third.
